### **Meteorological drought forecast monitor for Spain (4SPAIN)**

### The 4SPAIN dataset

**4SPAIN** is a system for seasonal predictions of meteorological drought in the Iberian Peninsula, which uses a probabilistic approach and can forecast up to four months in advance. The 4SPAIN application is available at the following link: https://matv.shinyapps.io/app_4spain/ 


These predictions are generated by applying an ensemble-based streamflow prediction system <span style="color:blue;">(ESP; Day, 1985; Twedt et al., 1977)</span>. This system uses the rearrangement of historical data and uses the ERA5 <span style="color:blue;">(Herbash et al., 2020)</span> data as initial conditions. To estimate drought, the Standardized Precipitation Index <span style="color:blue;">(SPI; McKee et al., 1993)</span> is used and calculated for a cumulative period of six months.
<br/>

4SPAIN is divided into two sections: "Forecast" (initial screen) and "Historical". **The "Forecast" section** shows future forecasts for the last available month. Because the data is monthly, the forecast is not updated until the end of the month. In addition, the ERA5 data is updated with a 6-day lag, which means that there may be a 6-day delay in the update. For example, if we are in the second half of May, the data shown are for the month of April. Therefore, as of April, we have forecasts for May, June and July.
<br/>

4SPAIN provides visual representations of the information in various forms:
<br/>

- **Drought conditions:** Drought conditions are classified into different severity levels, including "abnormally dry", "moderate drought", "severe drought", "extreme drought" and "exceptional drought".
<br/>

- **SPI dispersion:** The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) dispersion in 4SPAIN provides an estimate of forecast uncertainty. This measure of dispersion gives an idea of how reliable the SPI estimates are in different areas.
<br/>

- **SPI Alert Level:** This map is designed to help users distinguish between different levels of drought severity and their associated probability. The colors used indicate a combination of drought probability and severity, following the European Commission's disaster management guidelines  <span style="color:blue;">(EC 2010)</span>. For example, yellow could indicate a high probability of abnormally dry conditions or a low probability of severe drought.
<br/>

- **SPI Drought Probability Level:** This map shows the overall probability of experiencing at least moderate drought. It provides a more detailed illustration of the uncertainty in the 4SPAIN estimates and may be especially useful for more experienced drought users.

These 4SPAIN features and representations allow for a more complete understanding of drought forecasts and provide valuable information for decision making and management of drought-related events.
<br/>

In **the "Historical" section** of 4SPAIN, we can find the values of the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the drought conditions observed by the ERA5 reanalysis, as well as the SPI forecasts, the dispersion, the alert level and the drought probability level for the period from 1981 to the present.
<br/>

For example, when we select month 4 (April) in the "Choose a month" bar that allows us to represent the monthly information, by default, the forecast that was estimated two months earlier, i.e. in March, is shown. If we select the 3-month term in the "Choose a Lead-Time" bar, the forecast for the month of April that was estimated three months earlier, i.e. in the month of February, will be displayed. And if we select the 4-month lead-time, the April forecast that was estimated in January will be displayed. In summary, 4SPAIN provides information for three different time frames: 2 months (2M), 3 months (3M) and 4 months (4M), which allows us to analyze drought forecasts with different anticipations and time perspectives.
